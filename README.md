# HertzCarSalesDatabase
Web scraping used car details from a car dealing company website.

In this project I scraped used car information from https://www.hertzcarsales.com using their hidden API.
The car details are name, model, image uri, price, fuel type, mileage, transmission, and location.

The results are stored in a csv file, and I also downloaded each car image in a folder within the working diretory.
